EXAMPLE: TYPICAL 3RD HACKATHON PROBLEM AND COMPLETE SOLUTION

=================================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT (EXAMPLE - PROBLEM 3):
=================================================================

Title: "Smart Campus Food Waste Management System"

Background:
Food waste is a significant problem in educational institutions. Students and cafeteria staff
lack visibility into consumption patterns, leading to over-preparation, food spoilage, and
environmental impact. Current methods of tracking food waste are manual and inefficient.

Problem Statement:
Develop a comprehensive digital solution that helps reduce food waste in campus cafeterias
by tracking consumption patterns, predicting demand, and connecting surplus food with
those in need.

Requirements:
1. Web/mobile application for students to pre-order meals
2. Analytics dashboard for cafeteria management
3. AI-powered demand prediction system
4. Food donation/sharing feature for surplus food
5. Real-time inventory tracking
6. Waste measurement and reporting system

Constraints:
- 36-hour development time
- Must be mobile-responsive
- Should integrate with existing campus ID systems
- Focus on MVP with core features

Expected Deliverables:
- Working prototype/demo
- Source code with documentation
- Architecture diagram
- Presentation (10 minutes)
- Business model and impact analysis

- Regular commits every 2-3 hours
- Code reviews before merging

=================================================================

PHASE 5: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

üõ†Ô∏è Backend API Endpoints:
- POST /auth/login - User authentication
- GET /meals - Fetch available meals
- POST /orders - Create meal order
- GET /orders/:userId - User order history
- GET /analytics - Dashboard analytics
- POST /surplus - Report surplus food

üõ†Ô∏è Frontend Components:
- LoginPage, MealCatalog, OrderForm
- UserDashboard, StaffDashboard
- Analytics, SurplusSharing
- Navigation, Common UI components

üõ†Ô∏è Database Collections:
```
Users: {
  _id, campusId, name, email, role, preferences
}

Meals: {
